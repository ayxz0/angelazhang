## Project

This is my personal website / portfolio. It is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

Built with React, TSX, and TailwindCSS. Deployed on Vercel at [angelazhang.xyz](https://www.angelazhang.xyz)

## Getting Started

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
